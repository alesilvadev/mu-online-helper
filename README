#GUIDE

1- Install any missing dependencies by running the command: 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt. 
Ensure you are in the project directory when you run this command. This will install all the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

2- Navigate to the git project folder and edit the features you want in config.py. Important: change the CHARACTER_NAME variable to your in-game character name.

3- Open Mu Online with the resolution set to either 1440p or 1024p. Ensure the "borderless" and "windowed" options are selected.

4- Log into Mu Online using this configuration and your account.

5- Open a command line as an administrator. This could be PowerShell, cmd, Terminal on macOS, or whichever command interpreter you use.

To open as administrator on Windows:

Right-click on the application icon (cmd or PowerShell)
Select 'Run as administrator'
On MacOS or Linux:

Open the Terminal
Type 'sudo su', and then enter your password

6- Navigate to the project directory using the cd command. For example, if your project is located at C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MuOnline, 
you would type cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MuOnline and hit Enter.

7- Run the main project script with Python by typing python main.py into the command line and hitting Enter. Ensure you have the correct 
version of Python installed and that your command line is set up to recognize the python command.

#Note: 
If you receive an error message saying Python is not recognized as a command, you may need to add Python to your PATH environment variable. 
Alternatively, you might try using python3 instead of python.
